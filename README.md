## ‚öôÔ∏è Flow Steps
1. RTL design (`async_fifo.v`)  
2. Testbench simulation (`async_fifo_tb.v`)  

## üñ•Ô∏è Simulation
To run the testbench:
```bash
iverilog -o async_fifo_tb async_fifo.v async_fifo_tb.v
vvp async_fifo_tb
gtkwave async_fifo_tb.vcd
```

### Run RTL-to-GDSII Flow with OpenLane

Use the following command to launch the OpenLane Docker container and run the flow:

```bash
cd /home/USER/OpenLane && \
docker run --rm \
  -v /home/USER:/home/USER \
  -v /home/USER/OpenLane:/openlane \
  -v /home/USER/.volare:/home/USER/.volare \
  -e PDK_ROOT=/home/USER/.volare \
  -e PDK=sky130A \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  efabless/openlane:e73fb3c57e687a0023fcd4dcfd1566ecd478362a-amd64 \
  sh -c "./flow.tcl -design async_fifo -overwrite"
```

The src folder contains the RTL source file async_fifo.v and its associated timing constraints file async_fifo.sdc. These files serve as the primary input for the OpenLane RTL-to-GDS flow, defining the asynchronous FIFO design and its timing requirements. Any updates to the FIFO design or its constraints should be made within this folder to ensure they are correctly used during synthesis, placement, and routing.

The config.json defines the design parameters and flow settings for OpenLane, including RTL sources, clock constraints, and floorplan utilization.
It also specifies power distribution network (PDN) settings, guiding automated PnR and signoff steps for the async_fifo design.
